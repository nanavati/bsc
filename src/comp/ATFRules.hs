-- | Ground evaluation of associated type functions (ATFs) directly from
-- the instance declarations in the symbol table -- the "materialized
-- rewrite rules" that replace the ATF result cache.
--
-- An ATF's semantics is the set of equations its class's instances
-- declare: each instance contributes one equation (head patterns at the
-- ATF's parameter positions, result at the target position, plus the
-- instance context).  Reduction of a FULLY APPLIED application at
-- GROUND arguments (no type variables anywhere) is pure evaluation over
-- those equations: commit to the unique most-specific instance whose
-- head matches, then run the instance context's functional dependencies
-- -- also at ground types -- to bind whatever variables the result
-- still mentions.
--
-- On ground arguments, matching is plain structural pattern matching:
-- no substitution into the argument can change which equations match,
-- so "the most specific matching instance" is exactly the instance
-- reducePred commits to (it walks candidates most-specific-first and
-- takes the first match), reached with none of the typechecker's
-- machinery: no fresh-variable supply, no unification, no improvement,
-- no deferral, no incoherence judgment.  If two matching instances are
-- incomparable, the family's ground meaning is ambiguous -- the overlap
-- check rejects that for coherent classes, so hitting it here means an
-- unsealed/incoherent family leaked into permanent construction, and
-- the evaluator answers Nothing so the caller can fail loudly.
--
-- Everything outside the ground domain stays where it belongs:
--
--  * Applications over type variables are NOT reduced here.  Whether
--    and how they reduce is scope-dependent (rigid variables act as
--    atoms; see the bound_tyvars threading in TCMisc.sat) and is the
--    typechecker's judgment, consumed at generalization time.  In
--    ISyntax such applications simply stay dormant until substitution
--    grounds them.
--
--  * Satisfiability of the matched instance's context is NOT
--    re-verified.  Type-function reduction is fundep projection; the
--    dictionaries were the typechecker's obligation at the original
--    use site.  Context predicates are consulted only to bind
--    variables that the result mentions.
--
-- Callers in permanent construction (IConv / IExpand) treat a Nothing
-- from 'atfReduceGround' as an internal error: a ground application
-- whose family cannot reduce it means the instance set visible to this
-- compilation is missing (or is ambiguous about) an equation some
-- upstream typecheck relied on -- a real bug that must be loud, never
-- an occasion to fall back into the typechecker.
--
-- Known restriction: instance heads are matched structurally, so a
-- family whose selection relies on solving numeric equations in the
-- head (mgu's deferred numeric equalities) is outside the ground
-- domain and answers Nothing.  No ATF-carrying family in the current
-- libraries does this.

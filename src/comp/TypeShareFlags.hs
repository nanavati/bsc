-- | The type-sharing flag story, in one module so the hooks cannot
-- drift apart (previously the same flag string was read by multiple
-- independent CAFs).
--
-- One master, now default ON: the full exponential-killing world --
-- construction-time interning of ground normal forms on the CType side
-- (the certificate), the boundary interner + conversion memo, the
-- solve-time ground-dictionary pool, and every guard and memo keyed on
-- the certificate.  @-no-share-types@ backs the whole thing out, which
-- is the coarsest bisection step and the A/B control.
--
-- It is on by default because every fleet consumer was already passing
-- @-share-types@ explicitly, so "off" described no real configuration
-- while still being what an unadorned @bsc@ did.  @-share-types@ and
-- the legacy measurement aliases (@-hack-ctype-cons@,
-- @-hack-ground-ctype@) stay accepted as no-ops so existing command
-- lines keep working.  The IType side graduated to unconditional
-- interning with no master flag at all; this is the step before that.
--
-- Beneath the master, subtractive BACKOFFS, one per soundness
-- argument, for bug bisection only: each disables one class of
-- accelerations while the system stays correct (slower).  When a
-- miscompile is suspected, turning backoffs on one at a time
-- identifies the soundness claim that failed:
--   -share-types-no-identity  equal-id shortcuts (cmp, mgu, match)
--                             [claim: one canonical object per key]
--   -share-types-no-ground    ground guards (apSub, tv, inst, getFreeT)
--                             [claim: an EVEN id => ground; these are
--                             the four sites that may not settle for
--                             isCanonType, and quantify is why]
--   -share-types-no-normal    normal-form guards (expandSyn, expandSynN,
--                             expTFun, chkTAp, badCon)
--                             [claim: canonical => nothing to reduce]
--   -share-types-no-memo      context-free memos (nullary-synonym
--                             expansion, checked-clean set, per-id
--                             conversion) [claim: context-freeness]
--   -share-types-no-pool      the ground-dictionary pool
--                             [claim: coherence gate]
--
-- The IType side is graduated (interning is unconditional), so it has
-- no master flag; @-hack-no-itype-walk-memos@ is its layer-0
-- diagnostic in the style of @-hack-no-itype-ftv-cache@, disabling
-- the newer unconditional accelerations (kind-check memo, node-
-- identity equality shortcut, ATF-presence skip) for bisection.  Both
-- diagnostics are expected to be deleted once the machinery has aged.

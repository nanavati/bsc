# Performance baseline: bsim3 (interpreter) vs reference Bluesim

Measured 2026-07-08 on the development container (16 GB, shared load —
link times are min-of-3; treat as ~±20%).  Reference = installed bsc's
C++ Bluesim backend (`-sim`); bsim3 = `-sim3` (CBOR BIR export) run by
the P1 reference interpreter (release build).  All outputs byte-match.

## Compile and link

The `.bsv -> .ba` phase is shared between backends (identical cost).
The backend difference is the link phase: C++ codegen + g++ + ld
versus BIR export + wrapper.

| design                       | .bsv->.ba | link -sim (cold) | link -sim3 | speedup |
|------------------------------|-----------|------------------|------------|---------|
| sysVcdGT (toy, 5 prims)      | 0.57 s    | 0.61 s           | 0.030 s    | ~20x    |
| dft64 sysTb_v1 (PAClib FFT)  | 4.9 s     | 8.8 s            | 0.70 s     | ~13x    |
| sudoku mkGenerateTest3       | 35.7 s    | 14.7 s           | 1.31 s     | ~11x    |

Notes:
- bsc's per-object cache makes warm -sim relinks much cheaper (dft64:
  1.1 s), but -sim3 is still faster with no cache at all; BIR-side
  caching (content_hash) is designed but not implemented.
- For big designs the shared front-end dominates total build time, so
  end-to-end "edit -> run" improves by the link delta (sudoku: 50.4 s
  -> 37.0 s cold).

## Simulation throughput

| design                                | reference        | bsim3 (interp)   | ratio    |
|---------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|----------|
| sysLongCnt (3 rules, 5M cycles)       | 0.16 s (~30 Mcps)| 54.9 s (~91 Kcps)| ~335x    |
| sudoku mkGenerateTest3 (SAT-ish cones)| 0.36 s           | >600 s (killed)  | >1600x   |
| process startup (empty run)           | ~60 ms (bluetcl) | ~4 ms            | 15x (win)|

The interpreter walks the expression tree per evaluation and clones
`Value`s; large combinational cones (sudoku's solver) are the worst
case.  This is the expected P1 posture -- the interpreter is the
semantic oracle, not the product.  Closing the gap is exactly P2: JIT
the BIR to LLVM (rule bodies and CF/WF cones as native code, prims as
calls into bsim3-rt), differential-tested against the interpreter.
Target: within ~2x of the C++ backend initially, then faster than
Verilator per the DESIGN.md goals.

# Pre-edge-SSA baseline (2026-07-09, quiet machine)

Frozen BEFORE the edge-SSA transformation (task #24) so its wins are
measured against solid numbers.  Binary: decc231e + leash-fairness
tree (all g2 fixes; gate all-green 966/0/0 x 3 legs).  Reference =
installed bsc C++ Bluesim at -O3.  All runs byte-identical, x3.

## Wall clock (sudoku mkGenerateTest3, -m default full run)

| metric              | bsim3 artifact (O1) | reference | ratio  |
|---------------------|---------------------|-----------|--------|
| run                 | 0.48-0.51 s         | 0.31 s    | ~1.55x |
| startup (-m 1)      | 0.06 s              | 0.08 s    | win    |
| link                | 8.1 s (one-module)  | 13.9 s    | win    |
| LongCnt 5M (artifact, central loop) | 0.05-0.06 s | 0.27 s | 5x AHEAD |

## Where bsim3's 0.51s goes (BSIM3_PROF)

total 0.556s | dispatch 0.000s (fused edges: schedule IS code) |
ticks 0.137s (~25% — prim tick machinery, UNTOUCHED by edge-SSA;
also the central-loop #9 disqualifier) | prim cb 0 calls |
foreign cb 768 calls, 0.001s.  Remainder ~0.32s = compiled edge code
vs reference sim-only ~0.25s.

## Hardware counters (perf stat, P-core, full run)

| counter             | bsim3     | reference | ratio |
|---------------------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| cycles              | 1.060 B   | 0.667 B   | 1.59x |
| instructions        | 2.775 B   | 1.747 B   | 1.59x |
| IPC                 | 2.62      | 2.62      | SAME  |
| branches            | 514 M     | 317 M     | 1.62x |
| branch-miss rate    | 0.43%     | 0.62%     | win   |
| L1-dcache loads     | 1.128 B   | 0.435 B   | 2.59x |
| loads / instruction | 0.41      | 0.25      | —     |
| L1d load misses     | 17.2 M    | 1.15 M    | 15x   |
| LLC load misses     | 77 k      | 65 k      | ~same |

READING: IPC is IDENTICAL — the gap is pure instruction/load VOLUME,
not stalls.  Excess = 1.03B instructions, of which 0.69B (67%) are
data loads: the arena-slot round-trip signature.  Edge-SSA attacks
exactly this (values in registers, cross-rule sharing); the share
census sizes the recompute side at ~45% of per-edge def-eval mass
(recompute 16.6k vs total DAG 20.3k; hottest module type mir=2:
recompute 12.3k EXCEEDS its own DAG 10.5k).  The 15x L1d miss count
is the slot-scatter side effect (absorbed at same IPC today, but
free to remove).  Ticks (0.137s) are the post-edge-SSA residue to
attack next.  O-ladder: PARKED until full-edge composition (O3 today
buys only ~0.05s for +3s link on pre-SSA IR).
